\subsection*{Abstract}

R.G. Collingwood often rejects the methods of specific philosophical schools. Yet he is not always clear about his reasons. His rejection of a combative style of philosophical discussion at conferences and in seminars is a case in point. In this paper I identify Collingwood's conception of two modes of philosophical debate. I bring out how the root of his criticism of one of them can only be adequately understood when framed within his general account of intellectual change. Further, I suggest that Collingwood's point has a broader application. His criticism of his colleagues' behaviour can help us understand better what is wrong with combative styles of philosophy more generally. Hence, Collingwood's arguments aid the increasingly central project of improving the way philosophy is done.

On more than one occasion, Collingwood expressly disapproves of orally discussing material presented in seminars and at conferences, at least as his colleagues at Oxford pursued such discussions. His account in the _Autobiography_ (1939) makes manifest that few shared his rejection. To the contrary, at the time it met with hostility and scorn. What was Collingwood's criticism?

Collingwood's aversion to discussions intended to convince or refute, or, even worse, fully general discussions of philosophical ideas, is typically associated with the pages of the _Autobiography_ critical of Oxford Realism as developed by John Cook Wilson and H.A. Prichard. Yet those pages may easily give the impression that Collingwood's objections are primarily empirical or psychological: the concern that the effects of oral discussion on an opponent or audience are epistemically fleeting. This interpretation falls short. Although Collingwood would agree that such intellectual outcries in fact have little effect, I argue he has a more fundamental, systematic reason for dismissing such modes of philosophical discussion. He does not explicate that reason in the _Autobiography_. Instead, I suggest that we can find the most explicit statement of Collingwood's verdicts about philosophical discussion in _The New Leviathan_ (1942).

In _The New Leviathan_ Collingwood identifies a danger of thinking with false abstractions. He takes academic discussions---discussions aimed at conviction and refutation of 'views' or 'positions'---to fall prey to just that danger. Collingwood exploits Plato's distinction between _eristic_ and _dialectic_. Academic discussions, he thinks, are the best examples of eristic discussions. The problem with eristic discussion, he suggests, is that its starting point lies in abstraction. Collingwood admits that abstraction may be a necessary part of any kind of thinking (_NL_:26.18). But that does not take away that _false abstraction_ is problematic. False abstraction occurs when the two parties in a discussion take themselves to voice mutually independent positions, as if we could conceive their respective views in utter isolation. Such false abstractions presuppose a pernicious use of make-believe or fictional thinking. This is because the 'views' or 'positions' at issue do not exist on their own at all. Collingwood uses the example of a conflict between democratic and aristocratic conceptions of political life. By conceiving of a philosophical dispute as a disagreement between two or more such self-standing views, as philosophers tend to do, one loses sight of the fact that they are dialectically tied. In other words, in doing so, interlocutors suppress or forget the unity of their intellectual enterprise---they ignore that philosophical discussion aims at solving a particular philosophical problem. For Collingwood, I show, the right form of engaging in philosophical discussion requires a mindset that remains mistrustful of such abstraction and shows an interest in the actual problems, thoughts and reasoning of one's particular interlocutor.

Collingwood's discussion in _The New Leviathan_ sheds light on the pages of the _Autobiography_. His contemporaries' way of discussing philosophy was worthless, Collingwood thought, because they rooted their discussion in false abstractions. This is not an empirical or psychological objection, but one based on the observed interdependence of philosophical ideas and positions. When philosophers start to think of a philosophical position as something they can consider in isolation, the situation is always illusory and always dangerous (_NL_:27.52). Collingwood implies that conceiving of philosophical discussion as having the potential to convince someone of a particular view, or as possibly refuting another, already presupposes this kind of dialectical isolation. Any tradition of philosophy that elevates this conception of philosophical discussion to a professional standard or ideal---in the _Autobiography_ Collingwood singles out Oxford Realism---takes part in intellectual history uncomprehendingly (_NL_:27.56).

It has been close to eight decades since Collingwood voiced his criticism. However, in recent years an increasing number of philosophers have reached a similarly negative verdict about the typically combative way in which philosophers engage with one another in seminars and at conferences. They put pressure on the same antagonistic style of discourse that Collingwood judged unwelcome. The profession as a whole nowadays seems to take these negative attitudes towards combative styles of discussion increasingly serious. At the same time, significantly, even those concerned with improving the style of philosophical discussion tend to stick to the idea that philosophical disputes occur between 'views' or 'positions'. But if Collingwood is right, the disagreement driven style of debate is inherently intertwined with such abstractive thinking; one cannot criticize the one while retaining the other. Collingwood's arguments are of interest to wider debates on how to practice philosophy, because they force one to rethink the nature of philosophical disagreement.
